// Trace The trace object contains information about a distributed trace, which is
// crucial for observability. Traces are made up of one or more spans, which are
// individual units of work in application activity. Traces track the journey of a
// request as it moves through various services in a system, capturing key details
// like timing, status, and dependencies at each step. Traces provide insights into
// system performance, helping to identify latency, bottlenecks, and issues in
// complex, distributed environments.
type Trace struct {
	// The total time, in milliseconds, that the trace covers, calculated as the
	// difference between start_time and end_time. This duration helps assess the
	// overall performance of a request as it travels across various services, and
	// is essential for identifying latency and potential bottlenecks within the
	// distributed system. The trace duration may differ from individual span
	// durations due to the propagation and processing times of the trace as it
	// spans multiple components.
	Duration int64 `json:"duration,omitempty"`

	// The end timestamp of the trace, essential for identifying latency and
	// performance bottlenecks. Like the start time, this timestamp is normalized
	// across the trace system to ensure consistency, even when events are recorded
	// across distributed services with unsynchronized clocks. Normalized time
	// allows for accurate trace duration calculations and helps observability
	// tools track overall performance across services, regardless of the
	// individual system time settings.
	EndTime int64 `json:"end_time,omitempty"`

	// The end timestamp of the trace, essential for identifying latency and
	// performance bottlenecks. Like the start time, this timestamp is normalized
	// across the trace system to ensure consistency, even when events are recorded
	// across distributed services with unsynchronized clocks. Normalized time
	// allows for accurate trace duration calculations and helps observability
	// tools track overall performance across services, regardless of the
	// individual system time settings.
	EndTimeDt string `json:"end_time_dt,omitempty"`

	// The flags associated with the trace, used to indicate specific properties or
	// behaviors, such as whether the trace is sampled or if it has special
	// handling. Flags help control how traces are processed, logged, and analyzed,
	// providing valuable context for tracing and observability tools in
	// identifying trace characteristics or specific tracking requirements.
	Flags []string `json:"flags,omitempty"`

	// Identifies the service or component generating the trace, helping to track
	// and correlate the flow of requests through various parts of a distributed
	// system. This information is essential for understanding the role and
	// performance of specific services within the broader context of system
	// operations and for diagnosing issues across different components.
	Service *Service `json:"service,omitempty"`

	// Represents a single unit of work or operation within a distributed trace. A
	// span typically tracks the execution of a request across a service, capturing
	// important details such as the operation, timestamps, and status. Spans help
	// break down the overall trace into smaller, manageable parts, enabling
	// detailed analysis of the performance and behavior of specific operations
	// within the system. They are crucial for understanding latency, dependencies,
	// and bottlenecks in complex distributed systems.
	Span *Span `json:"span,omitempty"`

	// The start timestamp of the trace, essential for identifying latency and
	// performance bottlenecks. Like the end time, this timestamp is normalized
	// across the trace system to ensure consistency, even when events are recorded
	// across distributed services with unsynchronized clocks. Normalized time
	// enables accurate trace duration calculations and helps observability tools
	// track performance across services, regardless of the individual system time
	// settings.
	StartTime int64 `json:"start_time,omitempty"`

	// The start timestamp of the trace, essential for identifying latency and
	// performance bottlenecks. Like the end time, this timestamp is normalized
	// across the trace system to ensure consistency, even when events are recorded
	// across distributed services with unsynchronized clocks. Normalized time
	// enables accurate trace duration calculations and helps observability tools
	// track performance across services, regardless of the individual system time
	// settings.
	StartTimeDt string `json:"start_time_dt,omitempty"`

	// The unique identifier of the trace used in distributed systems and
	// microservices architecture to track and correlate requests across various
	// components of an application.
	Uid string `json:"uid,omitempty"`
