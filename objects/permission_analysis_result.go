// PermissionAnalysisResult The Permission Analysis object describes analysis results of permissions,
// policies directly associated with an identity (user, role, or service account).
// This evaluates what permissions an identity has been granted through attached
// policies, which privileges are actively used versus unused, and identifies
// potential over-privileged access. Use this for identity-centric security
// assessments such as privilege audits, dormant permission discovery, and
// least-privilege compliance analysis.
type PermissionAnalysisResult struct {
	// The condition keys and their values that were evaluated during policy
	// analysis, including contextual constraints that affect permission grants.
	// These conditions define when and how permissions are applied. Examples:
	// aws:SourceIp:1.2.3.4, aws:RequestedRegion:us-east-1.
	ConditionKeys []*KeyValueObject `json:"condition_keys,omitempty"`

	// The specific privileges, actions, or permissions that are explicitly granted
	// by the analyzed policy. Examples: AWS actions like s3:GetObject,
	// ec2:RunInstances, iam:CreateUser; Azure actions like
	// Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read; or GCP permissions like
	// storage.objects.get.
	GrantedPrivileges []string `json:"granted_privileges,omitempty"`

	// Detailed information about the policy document that was analyzed, including
	// policy metadata, version, type (identity-based, resource-based, etc.), and
	// structural details. This provides context for understanding the scope and
	// nature of the permission analysis.
	Policy *Policy `json:"policy,omitempty"`

	// The total count of privileges or actions defined in the policy that have not
	// been utilized within the analysis timeframe. This metric helps identify
	// over-privileged access and opportunities for privilege reduction to follow
	// the principle of least privilege. High counts may indicate policy bloat or
	// excessive permissions.
	UnusedPrivilegesCount int64 `json:"unused_privileges_count,omitempty"`

	// The total count of cloud services or resource types referenced in the policy
	// that have not been accessed or utilized within the analysis timeframe. This
	// helps identify unused service permissions that could be removed to reduce
	// attack surface. Examples: AWS services like S3, SQS, IAM, Lambda; Azure
	// services like Storage, Compute, KeyVault; or GCP services like Cloud
	// Storage, Compute Engine, BigQuery.
	UnusedServicesCount int64 `json:"unused_services_count,omitempty"`
