// Fingerprint The Fingerprint object provides detailed information about a digital
// fingerprint, which is a compact representation of data used to identify a longer
// piece of information, such as a public key or file content. It contains the
// algorithm and value of the fingerprint, enabling efficient and reliable
// identification of the associated data.
type Fingerprint struct {
	// The hash algorithm used to create the digital fingerprint, normalized to the
	// caption of algorithm_id. In the case of Other, it is defined by the event
	// source.
	Algorithm string `json:"algorithm,omitempty"`

	// The identifier of the normalized hash algorithm, which was used to create
	// the digital fingerprint.
	AlgorithmID int `json:"algorithm_id,omitempty"`

	// The digital fingerprint value.
	Value interface{} `json:"value,omitempty"`
