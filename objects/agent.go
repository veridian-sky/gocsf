// Agent An Agent (also known as a Sensor) is typically installed on an Operating System
// (OS) and serves as a specialized software component that can be designed to
// monitor, detect, collect, archive, or take action. These activities and possible
// actions are defined by the upstream system controlling the Agent and its
// intended purpose. For instance, an Agent can include Endpoint Detection &
// Response (EDR) agents, backup/disaster recovery sensors, Application Performance
// Monitoring or profiling sensors, and similar software.
