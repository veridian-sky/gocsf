// AdditionalRestriction The Additional Restriction object describes supplementary access controls and
// guardrails that constrain or limit granted permissions beyond the primary
// policy. These restrictions are typically applied through hierarchical policy
// frameworks, organizational controls, or conditional access mechanisms. Examples
// include AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs), Resource Control Policies (RCPs),
// Azure Management Group policies, GCP Organization policies, conditional access
// policies, IP restrictions, time-based constraints, and MFA requirements.
