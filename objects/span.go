// Span Represents a single unit of work or operation within a distributed trace. A span
// typically tracks the execution of a request across a service, capturing
// important details such as the operation, timestamps, and status. Spans help
// break down the overall trace into smaller, manageable parts, enabling detailed
// analysis of the performance and behavior of specific operations within the
// system. They are crucial for understanding latency, dependencies, and
// bottlenecks in complex distributed systems.
type Span struct {
	// The total time, in milliseconds, that the span represents, calculated as the
	// difference between start_time and end_time. It reflects the operation's
	// performance and latency, independent of event timestamps, and accounts for
	// normalized times used by observability tools to ensure consistency across
	// distributed systems.
	Duration int64 `json:"duration,omitempty"`

	// The end timestamp of the span, essential for identifying latency and
	// performance bottlenecks. Like the start time, this timestamp is normalized
	// across the observability system to ensure consistency, even when events are
	// recorded across distributed services with unsynchronized clocks. Normalized
	// time allows for accurate duration calculations and helps observability tools
	// track performance across services, regardless of the individual system time
	// settings.
	EndTime int64 `json:"end_time,omitempty"`

	// The end timestamp of the span, essential for identifying latency and
	// performance bottlenecks. Like the start time, this timestamp is normalized
	// across the observability system to ensure consistency, even when events are
	// recorded across distributed services with unsynchronized clocks. Normalized
	// time allows for accurate duration calculations and helps observability tools
	// track performance across services, regardless of the individual system time
	// settings.
	EndTimeDt string `json:"end_time_dt,omitempty"`

	// The message in a span (often referred to as a span event) serves as a way to
	// record significant moments or occurrences during the span's lifecycle. This
	// content typically manifests as log entries, annotations, or semi-structured
	// events as a string, providing additional granularity and context about what
	// happens at specific points during the execution of an operation.
	Message string `json:"message,omitempty"`

	// Describes an action performed in a span, such as API requests, database
	// queries, or computations.
	Operation string `json:"operation,omitempty"`

	// The ID of the parent span for this span object, establishing its
	// relationship in the trace hierarchy.
	ParentUID string `json:"parent_uid,omitempty"`

	// Identifies the service or component that generates the span, helping trace
	// its path through the distributed system.
	Service *Service `json:"service,omitempty"`

	// The start timestamp of the span, essential for identifying latency and
	// performance bottlenecks. This timestamp is normalized across the
	// observability system, ensuring consistency even when events occur across
	// distributed services with potentially unsynchronized clocks. By using
	// normalized time, observability tools can provide accurate, uniform
	// measurements of operation performance and latency, regardless of where or
	// when the events actually occur.
	StartTime int64 `json:"start_time,omitempty"`

	// The start timestamp of the span, essential for identifying latency and
	// performance bottlenecks. This timestamp is normalized across the
	// observability system, ensuring consistency even when events occur across
	// distributed services with potentially unsynchronized clocks. By using
	// normalized time, observability tools can provide accurate, uniform
	// measurements of operation performance and latency, regardless of where or
	// when the events actually occur.
	StartTimeDt string `json:"start_time_dt,omitempty"`

	// Indicates the outcome of the operation in the span, such as success,
	// failure, or error. Issues in a span typically refer to problems such as
	// failed operations, timeouts, service unavailability, or errors in processing
	// that can negatively impact the performance or reliability of the system.
	// Tracking the `status_code` helps pinpoint these issues, enabling quicker
	// identification and resolution of system inefficiencies or faults.
	StatusCode string `json:"status_code,omitempty"`

	// The unique identifier for the span, used in distributed systems and
	// microservices architectures to track and correlate requests across different
	// components of an application. It enables tracing the flow of a request
	// through various services.
	Uid string `json:"uid,omitempty"`
