// VendorAttributes The Vendor Attributes object can be used to represent values of attributes
// populated by the Vendor/Finding Provider. It can help distinguish between the
// vendor-provided values and consumer-updated values, of key attributes like
// severity_id. The original finding producer should not populate this object. It
// should be populated by consuming systems that support data mutability.
type VendorAttributes struct {
	// The finding severity, as reported by the Vendor (Finding Provider). The
	// value should be normalized to the caption of the severity_id value. In the
	// case of 'Other', it is defined by the source.
	Severity string `json:"severity,omitempty"`

	// The finding severity ID, as reported by the Vendor (Finding Provider).
	SeverityID int `json:"severity_id,omitempty"`
